This artifact was part of a project for my CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering course. The prompt behind it was a simple client tracking program, and it was mainly to be used just to translate into assembly language, then into binary, and then back to C++. It is a very simple, single class program with a command prompt style text entry interface. I selected this artifact because while the original program was very simple, the idea behind it is a good one. It was also very barebones, which made it a great candidate for enhancement, as it could use a lot of enhancing.

Translating the artifact from C++ to Java showcases my proficiency with multiple programming languages. The original code had some methods to validate integers and strings, methods for logging in, and for updating certain components of clients in the list. This gave me a chance to use object oriented programming principles to make the code more modular by creating new classes. I also had the opportunity to make a much more user friendly interface with text entry fields, dropdown menus and clickable buttons. The security in the original code was worse than poor. Users had to enter a username and password to “log in” to the system, but the username was never checked against anything to make sure it was a good username, and the only password that allowed access was “123”. This gave me a chance to showcase my skill in secure coding by making a more robust log in validation. I’m very pleased to say that I have managed to do all of the above.
  
In my original plan, the course outcomes I meant to achieve with these enhancements were “2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts”, “3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices”, “4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals”, and “5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources”. I believe I have met these outcomes as planned. 
  
2 was met by designing a new user interface from scratch and including helpful code comments. 3 was met by porting the code from C++ to Java, making it platform independent and making memory management safer while also improving modularity and functionality by creating new classes using object oriented programming principles. I had to take trade-offs into account for this as well. While Java is more portable as it is platform independent and has increased safety in terms of memory management, it also takes a hit in performance as it is not pre-compiled as it is in C++. I decided this was an acceptable trade-off, as it is a smaller scale software solution with limited functionality. I may have made a different decision if this was a very large and complex program. 4 was met by using my skills and techniques to add value to the program by making it more accessible to everyone by porting it to a platform independent language. The addition of extra security, modularity and functionality also added value and accomplished industry-specific goals. Finally, 5 was met by mitigating memory vulnerabilities by porting to Java from C++, the addition of password hashing to encrypt passwords, and a more robust password validation method.

These enhancements taught me a lot. I don’t have a lot of experience creating nice user interfaces with javax.swing, so there was a lot of using references and trial and error building that. I also learned I have a hard time reining myself in sometimes. I get ideas and try to run with them, even when they are more than what I originally intended. Sometimes that may not be a bad thing, but other times I should try to keep to the plan a bit more. One of the larger challenges I faced was with testing the enhancements. As the whole program had to be created anew in Java, I didn’t have much of a baseline to compare to. Also, I am using this same artifact for the enhancements in Data structures and algorithms as well as databases. Because of that, some functionality has not yet been realized, such as the CRUD methods and search functions. These will be completed in the next round of enhancements. I will be creating a CRUD class to hold all of the CRUD methods, such as creating users and customers, updating customer information, and deleting customers from the database. I will also be implementing a robust search function, which will allow a user to search the entire customer base using any of the attributes (customer ID, first or last name, address, etc.). The SQLite database will be created using DBeaver, and the CRUD methods will include connecting to the database and using prepared statements to guard against SQL injection for security. Also, as I have not yet created the SQLite database, I cannot finish the login and user registration methods yet. That being said, I believe I have adequately shown my skills in software design and engineering with the enhancements I have completed here.
