# Computer Science Capstone

## CS 499 | SNHU

### About Me
**My name is Joseph Caron. I am currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University about to earn my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. My goal is to begin a career as a software developer.**

### Code Review
**I created a code review video in order to get a comprehensive look at one of my earlier projects from my college career. I went over the entirety of the code, explaining itâ€™s intended use and faults, as well as going over my planned enhancements.**

**<code>You can watch the video <a href="https://youtu.be/VLXJZ9kP_cU">here</a>.</code>**

**The entirety of this project, three rounds of enhancements on a artifact from a previous course at SNHU, was completed on a single artifact from my CS 410 Reverse Software Engineering course. It was originally designed as a customer tracking program for an investment company, accessed through a text only terminal window, and was vvery minimal.**

#### Project 1: Software Design and Engineering

**This is the first round of enhancements made to the project_1 artifact. I created a new user interface, added functionality, and ported the entire program from C++ to Java. This showcases my ability to code in multiple languages, balance trade-offs with design choices, and add functionality to existing programs.**

#### Project 2: Data Structures and Algorithms

**This is the second round of enhancements made to the project_1 artifact. I created a CRUD class to handle CRUD methods, and included a full spectrum search function allowing users to search for customers based on any of the attributes assigned to each customer, i.e. ID number, first name, address, etc. This showcases my ability to work with search function algorithms, as well as CRUD methods which are also algorithms, albeit less complex ones.**

#### Project 3: Databases

**This is the final round of enhancements made to the project_1 artifact. I created a SQLite database using DBeaver to house all user and customer information. I aso integrated the CRUD class created in the previous enhancements to be able to manage the database. The database consists of two tables: the users table and the customers table. The users table has columns of "username", "password", "name" and "job_title". The username column is the primary key for the table. The customers table has columns of "custId", "first_name", "last_name", "address", "phone", "email" and "status". The custId column is the primary key. This showcases my ability to create and manage databases, as well as integrating databases to a java based program.**
