### About Me
**My name is Joseph Caron. I am currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University about to earn my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. My goal is to begin a career as a software developer.**

### Code Review
**I created a code review video in order to get a comprehensive look at one of my earlier projects from my college career. I went over the entirety of the code, explaining itâ€™s intended use and faults, as well as going over my planned enhancements.**
